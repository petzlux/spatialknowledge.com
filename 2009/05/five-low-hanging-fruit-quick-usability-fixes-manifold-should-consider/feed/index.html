		<description>I was using Manifold Universal, which is around $600. I&#039;ve had no formal GIS training, but we inherited using Manifold from a consultant. When I last wrote, I&#039;d been using Manifold for about six months. I&#039;m an engineer, and I basically use GIS as 2D(ish) CAD system for building up constraint layers for power plant location design.

When I load a layer from a data source, I want it to appear on the map I&#039;m working on immediately, thank you. Manifold made that difficult, adding steps like assigning projection, then adding the drawing to the map. Manifold&#039;s tab structure along the bottom of the map is much more cumbersome than having layers on a palette at the side. 

I stand by my shock-troops comment about the Manifold forums. I may not have followed the exact checklist required by St.Eric&#039;s &quot;How To Ask Questions The Smart Way&quot;, but one generally doesn&#039;t expect the developer of a commercial product to weigh in in a rude and aggressive manner as a response. The customer may not always be right, but he does pay your salary.

Now that QGIS is very stable on Windows, I haven&#039;t used Manifold for more than a year.</description>

		<description>scruss, common.  &quot;expensive joke&quot;, &quot;shock-troops&quot;  and not using &quot;layers&quot;.  I have been trained in ESRI porducts and have used Manifold.  Both have their unique issues, but Manifold is quite easy to understand and use.  It is readily picked up by our untrained staff.  The support people are quite helpful as is the forum.  The price is in the $200 range depending on what features you want.  It is unhelpful to just blurt out funny little comments, I&#039;m not sure you have enven used the product.</description>

		<description>Patrick, it&#039;s quite simple: Manifold doesn&#039;t use the term &quot;layer&quot; in the way that every other GIS package does. The fact you have to make separate maps from layers, and then fight to add simple things (like labels: I mean, c&#039;mon!) is a major turnoff.

Manifold may be an exceptionally powerful database backend (well, as powerful as JET &quot;whoops, I had your data a moment ago&quot; can be) but its UI bites. Added to the shock-troops on the support site, it&#039;s been an expensive joke for me. If only QGis could get their QT stability sorted on Windows, it would be my data mangler of choice.</description>

		<description>Mike,

Again, can you elaborate on the problems you seemed to have? In my experience, the activation system works as it is supposed too. What for me is an issue at the moment is the time span waiting for v9 and thus new activation keys, as I am running out of activations! I dont know if this is what you mean?</description>

		<description>The broken activation key system+instructions+support have caused us enough frustration to uninstall the product. Frankly I&#039;m stunned.</description>

		<description>Scruss

Would you care to explain what specifically you find so difficult when compared to other GIS software packages? I often hear comments like this from other GIS users that have been trained in using ESRI or Mapinfo. What then happens is that the user expects functionality to be implemented the same way in Manifold as it is in the GIS package the user is accustomed with.

What this doesnt address then is the overall usability, ie. what way is actually the &quot;best&quot; way to do it. ESRI in my opinion is less usable than Manifold, but because most users have learnt ESRI&#039;s idiosyncracies, they expect the same from Manifold!</description>

		<description>Manifold may be very powerful, and has a low purchase price, but the user interface is extremely poor. There must be a reason for them to work wilfully differently from every other GIS, but I currently can&#039;t seem to work out what it is.</description>

		<description>My feature request for 1. Setting AOI of Layouts

Concept:
Views are a handy way to control Layout AOI and the present View Pane would be the dialog for control.
Now compare View Pane to Selection Pane. There you have a build-in selections [Invisible Pixel] for images. Carry this concept over to View Pane and have a build-in View [Current View] and use this as the default for a new Layout.

Implementation:
By experiance I definite disapprove ArcViews concept of a &quot;living view&quot; following each later change of viewpoint or scale. Applying the [Current View] by default or by a later selection should internally be interpreted as setting a fixed scope of Locked Center / Scale.</description>
