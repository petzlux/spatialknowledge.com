		<description>This is a great methodology!  I&#039;ve been using SketchFlow as a great tool to interactively take my clients through the design/build process.  The nice feature about this tool is that it is part of the Microsoft Expression Studio kit and takes the &quot;drafts&quot; to final product almost seamlessly.</description>

		<description>Hi Patrick,
Thanks for the links and good to see that you&#039;re working on usability aspects of your application. Paper Prototyping has been used in GIS - not very frequently - since the mid 1990s (see http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=266399.266412) . The real issue with paper prototyping is that it&#039;s a great tool to discuss the interface with end users - so make sure that your end users are happy with it!</description>
