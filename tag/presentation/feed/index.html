CASA, <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=WC1E+7HB&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=17&amp;om=1&amp;iwloc=A">Basement Lecture Theatre, 1-19 Torrington Place</a>, UCL</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="color: #663366;">Location  Intelligence: an innovative approach to business location decision  making</span><br />
</strong>As one of the leading ‘world cities’  London is home to a highly internationalised workforce and is particularly reliant on these sources of foreign direct investment (FDI). In the face of increasing global competition and a very difficult economic climate, the capital must compete effectively to encourage and support such investors. Through a collaborative study with London’s official foreign direct investment agency, Think London, the need for a coherent framework for data, methodologies and tools to inform business location decision making became apparent. This presentation will discuss the development of a rich environment to iteratively explore, compare and rank London’s business neighbourhoods alongside ancillary data. This is achieved through the development, integration and evaluation of data and its manipulation to form a model for locational based decision support. Firstly, we discuss the development of a geo-business classification for London which draws upon methods and practices common to many geospatial neighbourhood classifications that are used for profiling consumers. In this instance a geo-business classification is developed by encapsulating relevant location variables using Principal Component Analysis into a set of composite area characteristics. Secondly, we discuss the implementation an appropriate Multi-Criteria Decision Making methodology, in this case Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), enabling the aggregation of the geo-business classification and decision makers preferences into discrete decision alternatives (Carver 1991; Jankowski 1995). Lastly, we present the preliminary results of the integration of both data and model through the development and evaluation of a web-based prototype and evaluate its usefulness through scenario  testing.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you didn&#8217;t get a chance to fly down to Sydney to attend the FOSSG4 conference (I certainly didn&#8217;t!), they now have video casts up of most presentations at <a href="http://blip.tv/search?q=fosslc">http://blip.tv/search?q=fosslc</a>. One I found interesting was a great video cast of the presentation by Paul Ramsey on development progress on PostGIS at the recent FOSSG4.</p>
<p>A great mention as well for Manifold as one of the GIS packages supporting PostGIS in the video by Paul Ramsey, although he alleges to some FUD that Manifold the company spread regarding PostGIS ( at 13:15 in the video, although I don&#8217;t remember what particular Dimitri postings he was referring too :-)</p>

<p>According to Paul&#8217;s presentation, PostGreSQL (with PostGIS) certainly seems to be at least equal to other spatially enabled databases in terms of feature completeness, performance and robustness, and its free, making procurement much easier (19:00 min in video). And the new release of PostGIS seems to be all about speed improvements, which is obviously a good thing. A overview of the roadmap ahead for PostGIS promises a lot of things to come&#8230;</p>
<p>Now, my interest in PostGIS has only started lately, mostly because I was asked to develop a &#8220;Introduction to Spatial Databases&#8221; e-learning course. Given the need for students to be able to run the practicals on their home computers, we chose PostGIS and Quantum GIS as the software tools for the tutorials. I must say I have been impressed by the functionality of PostGIS, and it certainly hasn&#8217;t been a very steep learning curve for me, thanks mostly to my previous Spatial SQL knowledge learned from Manifold&#8217;s Spatial SQL experience. Although the syntax and some of the commands are slightly different between PostGIS SQL and Manifold Spatial SQL, knowledge of either is really helpful when trying to write queries! Wider issues of optimisation such as spatial indexes though present another level of complexity/power in PostGIS,  which Manifold&#8217;s internal SQL engine doesn&#8217;t expose to the user.</p>
