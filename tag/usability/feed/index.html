			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of the induction week for the new cohort of the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/gis/">MSc in GIS</a> here at the <a href="http://www.cege.ucl.ac.uk/">Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering</a>, I organised a <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_parties">OpenStreetMap Mapping Party</a>. OSM mapping is not only a fun activity that gets the students out of the classroom and getting to know each other, but also serves as a convenient introduction to a wide range of geo-challenges relevant to their MSc, both in terms of data collection quality and attributes, editing and updating of spatial data, as well as the visualisation and processing of collected data.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Central London is already mapped to a high level of detail (not astonishing given that OSM originates from UCL!), so we decided to focus on a much neglected topic, ie wheelchair accessibility mapping. <a href="http://wheelmap.org">Wheelmap.org</a>, a relatively new initiative to highlight wheelchair accessible places, made it painfully obvious that almost no accessibility mapping had been done so far in and around UCL!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_20110928_151337.jpg by petz, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/petzlux/6195205367/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6164/6195205367_cb1208ec50.jpg" alt="IMG_20110928_151337.jpg" width="400" height="239" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www2.cege.ucl.ac.uk/arg/people/staffpage.asp?StaffID=571">Catherine Holloway</a>, a wheelchair accessibility specialist from our department, gave a great overview of relevant attributes to map, and even brought along a couple of wheelchairs for the students to sit in! Two of the student groups experienced the difficulties when trying to move about in a wheelchair, hitting obstacles, bad dropped kerbs and rough surfaces, a valuable insight into the very specific mobility problems of London&#8217;s wheelchair users.<br />
The mapping party was also kindly supported by members of the OSM community, ie. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/GGLIOZZO">Gianfranco</a>,  <a href="http://derickrethans.nl/">Derick Rethans</a>, and Alex who shadowed groups and supported them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="IMG_20110928_150403.jpg by petz, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/petzlux/6195720974/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6141/6195720974_5bde1540dd.jpg" alt="IMG_20110928_150403.jpg" width="400" height="239" /></a></p>
<p>The first day was taken up with data collection, and the weather god(s) were very kind to us, with atypically warm and sunny weather for this time of the year, ideal to explore the different areas around UCL&#8217;s main campus. We subdivided the area into map slices, and 4 groups went off to collect data, each group recording their progress on <a href="http://walking-papers.org/">walkingpapers</a> print outs. After some initial confusion over what to capture, the groups soon got to grips with the task and went their separate ways to record: if shops and building entrances have step free access and if the toilets are wheelchair accessible; where dropped kerbs are; as well as pavement quality and minimum widths.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="IMG_20110928_155729.jpg by petz, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/petzlux/6195726730/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6170/6195726730_27e04245fe.jpg" alt="IMG_20110928_155729.jpg" width="400" height="239" /></a></p>
<p>My group did south of UCL around Tottenham Court Road, and sadly we found <a href="http://wheelmap.org/?zoom=18&amp;lat=51.51975&amp;lon=-0.13256&amp;layers=BT">a whole row of shops not wheelchair accessible in Store Street</a> (see photo above). I must say that I was shocked by the number of businesses, pubs and buildings which today are still not wheelchair accessible, just in the very small area we mapped around UCL. After a productive two hours of mapping, we reconvened at the Department, to go for a well deserved pint of beer in the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/108042">Jeremy Bentham pub</a> (an essential part of any proper mapping party!).</p>
<p><a title="IMG_20110929_142155.jpg by petz, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/petzlux/6195729596/"><img class="aligncenter" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6176/6195729596_75765a8dc1.jpg" alt="IMG_20110929_142155.jpg" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>On day 2, the students sat down to add their collected data to OSM, using Potlatch2. <a href="http://www.gravitystorm.co.uk/shine/">Andy Allan</a>, one of the lead developers of Potlatch2, joined us for the lab session to support the students, but also importantly to experience how first time editors of OSM are using his software. In parallel, I setup screen recording software to gather new data on first time users interactions with OSM&#8217;s editing tools, in this case Potlatch2, in continuation of earlier work done in <a title="OpenStreetMap – Where’s the Search?" href="http://www.spatialknowledge.eu/2011/05/openstreetmap-wheres-the-search/">usability analysis, reported here before.</a> Apart from some of the previously discussed problems in the usability of Potlatch2, of which Andy took keen notice and I am sure he will report back on as well, the students got on well with the editing. Soon the first <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/changesets?bbox=-0.136496%2C51.521571%2C-0.130826%2C51.524435">changesets </a>appeared on OSM, and the first tagged shops were updated as well on <a href="http://wheelmap.org/?zoom=17&amp;lat=51.52177&amp;lon=-0.13591&amp;layers=BT">wheelmap.org</a>. Some students even managed to finish early, taking the opportunity to edit and add information around their homes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="IMG_20110929_151204.jpg by petz, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/petzlux/6195214055/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6022/6195214055_d317111c57.jpg" alt="IMG_20110929_151204.jpg" width="400" height="239" /></a></p>
<p>The results of the mapping party can be seen in the changesets generated by the students, as well as the numerous classified shops and amenities along Tottenham Court Road and its sidestreets, visible in wheelmap.org, where before there was just a sea of grey unclassified Points of Interest.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick pointer to the <a href="http://matterhorn.zserv.tuwien.ac.at/engage/ui/watch.html?id=Unscheduled-lecturetube-treitler-1310738966681">recording of the presentation of the joint work between Dr Catherine Jones and myself here at SOTMEU</a> (I only got the video to work in Firefox!) So, far a great and vibrant conference, and our research into usability issues in OpenStreetMap was well received. I was particularly pleased by the positive reaction from a lot of conference attendants to our work, it seems that most core community members are well aware of the issues we raised, and recognise the need for improvement.</p>
<p>This small research project from us then represents the first of an ongoing effort to better embed and implement a usability engineering culture in this great project!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roughly <a href="http://neis-one.org/2010/08/%E2%80%9Enominal-members%E2%80%9C-of-osm/">70% of visitors who open an account do not go on to make a single edit to OpenStreetMap</a>. Why do the majority of people interested in editing OSM fail to add data? Is the user experience not good enough? What are some specific issues that stop contributions? These are some of the questions that I, together with <a href="http://www.port.ac.uk/departments/academic/geography/staff/title,109932,en.html">Dr Kate Jones</a>, are currently investigating through an in-depth OpenStreetMap usability study, which will be presented at the upcoming <a href="http://sotm-eu.org/">SOTM-EU conference</a>.</p>
<p>We just finished our data collection exercise, which included<a href="http://www.tobii.com/en/analysis-and-research/global/research/usability/"> eye tracking</a> and screen recording ten OSM novices through their first experience registering, adding and editing information to OSM. A OSM test server enabled participants to complete registration, search for a specific scenario area, add and edit 11 features using Potlatch2, while being tracked and observed by a researcher. Although we will present comprehensive results from this study at the conference and the proceedings, I want to give just a quick glimpse into some of the very basic issues we have uncovered so far.</p>
<h3>Where is the OSM Search?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o3ZiosKtnA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o3ZiosKtnA</a></p>
<p>We discovered that users have difficulty locating the Search on <a href="http://www.osm.org">openstreetmap.org</a>. This has been <a href="http://compton.nu/2010/02/redesigning-the-openstreetmap-web-site/">highlighted </a>before. This video shows the gaze plot of one participant looking for the OSM search. The participant first tries to find the search functionality at the top of the page, scanning from left to right and back in vain. Only after having spent 6 seconds looking at the top, the participant starts to scan and read down the left-hand side of the page, before stumbling over the search at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Questions arise over the natural way in which users scan a webpage,and preconceptions about where they would expect a search functionality to appear. According to <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/reading_pattern.html">Nielsen</a>, user reading behaviour of websites exhibits a dominant reading pattern which looks somewhat like an F, with two horizontal movements across the top and middle of a given page, before moving on to a vertical movement scanning the left content section. This pattern has been recognized and adopted by many prominent websites, creating in turn preconceptions in users as to where to expect prominent content/functionalities. Google for example consistently locates their search box on the top-left to middle of a given website.</p>
<p>This video is only an example of the consistent behaviour we have observed of participants exposing the F pattern when looking for Search. As the OSM website now stands, the Search functionality (which works  well and is helpful once found!) is not in a clear and quickly visible area of the website, but &#8220;<em>hidden</em>&#8221; in a &#8220;<em>drill-down</em>&#8221; area last seen by the user.</p>
<p>As I said, lots more stuff to come out of this study, watch this space if you can&#8217;t make it to SOTM-EU!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of my research work, I am developing a spatial decision support system for inward investment promotion. The design and user interface for the system needs careful consideration and development, given that the end product will be used primarly by non experts.</p>
<p>Having decided on a basic methodology for the decision making process, we are now in the process of developing UI <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock-up">mockups</a>, which we can present to stakeholders to get their opinion of the system. UI mockups allow an early view on the look &amp; feel , i.e. usability of the system, and allow the designer to easily collect feedback from users and integrate changes without having to modify/rewrite code.  For my project, I also hope that I can give stakeholders a better understanding of the system development process and of the project&#8217;s main aims through this showcase.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-126 alignnone" title="mockup of SDSS" src="http://www.spatialknowledge.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/balsamiq1.png" alt="mockup of SDSS" width="424" height="249" /></p>
<p>I have been looking at different methodologies for producing such UI mockups, and how they have been applied to GIS &amp; SDSS type projects. I must say that I have only found <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=gis+interface+mockup">sparse evidence</a> of systematic efforts by GIS practitioners to apply usability principles through the use of mockups  in GIS development activities. My view also is corroborated by Muki in his <a href="http://povesham.wordpress.com/2009/05/07/neo-and-paleo-gis-%E2%80%93-is-the-difference-in-the-usability-culture/">recent blog post</a>, where he argues that usability and the processes in software development that ensure good usability still seem to be considered a nice to have, and the GIS industry lacks a &#8220;<em>usability culture</em>&#8220;, inherent other industry sectors.</p>
<p>But I digress&#8230;  As always, there are multiple methods of doing UI mockups. One of the most straightforward and widely used methods uses paper, pen and scissors to physically create the UI elements, which can then be arranged into an UI mockup. This of course is very flexible as you can easily create and assemble together whatever user interface elements one needs or wants.A digital equivalent is to use PowerPoint or any other general purpose drawing tool to generate the UI mockup. But there are also drawbacks. Physical UI mockups can get lost/destroyed, are not easy to revise, and changes can&#8217;t easily be tracked. Digital mockups made with PowerPoint are also cumbersome to generate, and one needs to invest a lot of time into generating basic UI elements (altough <a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20071018/powerpoint-prototype-toolkit-01/">some templates</a> to get you started are available). With PowerPoint mockups, you can even generate <a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/interactive">basic interactivity inside the mockup</a> by creating links between slides, altough this is still cumbersome.</p>
<p>Obviously, a specific quick and dirty design tool for mockups would be great, and thats exactly what I found with <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq Mockups</a>. They have both a free online tool version as well as a desktop application version available, which supports features such as dynamic links between screens. Also, Balsamiq Mockups intentionally uses <span class="highlight">hand-drawn UI elements</span> to generate &#8220;<em>paper quality mockups</em>&#8220;, so that people don&#8217;t get attached to “<em>that pretty color gradient</em>” or think that your mockup has actual code behind it and is “<em>practically done</em>”.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" style="text-align: center;"><object width="425" height="355" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/aJTuFRaIi_g" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/aJTuFRaIi_g" /></object></div>
<p>I just spent the afternoon creating such a mockup for my project, and I am more than happy with the results, even though they only offer a basic &#8220;map&#8221; element which is specific to GIS. But the rest of the template of pre defined UI elements is rich enough to model most GIS related UI.</p>
<p>I would urge any GIS developer who hasn&#8217;t used mockups for their application development process before to give it a try and enjoy the benefits of better usability for their applications and happier users!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past four years that I have been using Manifold on a daily basis for almost all of my professional work, I have been able to develop a good understanding of its strengths, idiosyncrasies  and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Even so, it is when working with other Manifold users, and specifically <a href="http://www.manipedia.eu/index.php?title=February_12th_and_13th_2009_-_Manifold_GIS_Training_Course">teaching Manifold to new users</a>, that one can often find basic usability issues at hand that go unnoticed by more seasoned Manifold users like myself. In this post, I do not want to address larger and more complicated issues, but instead focus on providing a small list of low hanging fruit that could easily be fixed by the Manifold development team:</p>
<h2>1) Setting Area of Interest in Layouts</h2>
<p>During our training course, almost all new users needed help to understand how to set the area of interestof a layout. The way to change the AOI of a map component in a layout might be powerful, but is complex and well hidden from the user in multiple steps. Most users will upon the creation of a layout from a map, expect the zoom extent of the layout to be the same as what they see in the map component. Confusion sets in when the whole component, or worse a blank page, greets them when they open their newly created layout. &#8220;<em>Hey where&#8217;s my nice map gone?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-107" title="layers" src="http://www.spatialknowledge.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/layers.png" alt="layers" width="163" height="197" />The process then is less than straighforward and involves in total 8 steps and at least as many mouseclicks : right-click on the layout (1) and choose properties (2), set the Scope to Locked Rectangle (3), go back to the map component (4), goto View -&gt; Panes -&gt; Layers (5) (as that pane is hidden by default!), using the Layers Pane, enable the Layout Component extent rectangle (6), resize to the AOI the extent rectangle (7), finally go back to the Layout (8).</p>
<p>Ideally, users would expect after selecting a layout map component that it would behave like a regular map component where users can pan and zoom to set a AOI for the layout.</p>
<h2>2) Formatting toolbar</h2>
<p>Most new users will stumble over one of the more fundamental idiosyncrasies the Manifold user interface has to offer. The concept of the formatting toolbar relies on the fact that, as opposed to other GIS packages, one drawing can contain different geometry types (points, lines, areas). This is reflected in the formatting toolbar, which always offers the user formatting options for all three geometry types. Because the formatting options look <img src="file:///C:/DOCUME~1/pweber/LOCALS~1/Temp/moz-screenshot.jpg" alt="" /><strong>very</strong> similar to one another, new users are often deeply confused and unshure which icon they need to click to influence for example the line foreground color.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-105" title="formatting" src="http://www.spatialknowledge.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/formatting.png" alt="formatting" width="445" height="52" /></p>
<p>One straightforward solution would be to blank out formatting options for geometry types not currently present in a specific drawing, thus simplifying the toolbar considerably (for a lines only drawing, this would reduce the number of icons from 17 icons down to 4!).</p>
<p>Another possible solution would be to indicate through a small text box what geometry type a set of formatting icons refers to, instead of relying on users to find the right option by hovering over an icon or trial and error.</p>
<h2>3) Label Display Options</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-106 aligncenter" title="labels" src="http://www.spatialknowledge.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/labels.png" alt="labels" width="299" height="194" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When working with labels, users are often at a loss on where to change advanced options such as callouts, label overlap conflicts and line label placement. Users in general will look first in the component specific menu, i.e. the Labels Menu, where they wont find a entry for such advanced display options. Instead, Label display options are &#8220;hidden from the user&#8221; in the generic View Menu. The same applies to for the display options of surfaces and images.</p>
<p>IMHO it would make much more sense to group all options relating to a specific component type in the specific Menu for that component, i.e. the &#8220;Labels&#8221; Menu or &#8220;Surfaces&#8221; Menu.</p>
<h2>4) Queries in Layouts</h2>
<p>A table dragged into a layout results in the creation of a layout component displaying table records. This makes sense to the user and he is pleased to be able to include tabular data into his layout to generate reports.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the same doesn&#8217;t happen for queries dragged into a layout. From Manifold&#8217;s perspective, the software sticks to its principles and generates a layout component containing the SQL Query text. 99% of the time, this isn&#8217;t the most useful behaviour, and a user would rather expect the query results table to be generated and placed into the layout.</p>
<p>It would be much better if users were given a choice if they wanted the query text, or the query results to be included in the layout. (The workaround I currently employ in this situation is to run a query which generates a table which in turn is included in a layout, which is fine except you can&#8217;t update the table easily without deleting it and rerunning the query, thus loosing the layout position).</p>
<h2>5) The Query Toolbar</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, this one was already touched upon by <a href="http://povesham.wordpress.com/2008/02/29/confusing-interfaces/">Muki on his blog</a>,  but it is worth repeating his comment here, as the change is the most straightforward to implement on this list:<img class="size-full wp-image-108 aligncenter" title="query" src="http://www.spatialknowledge.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/query.png" alt="query" width="514" height="50" /></p>
<blockquote><p>The way the query toolbar works is that you select a <strong>field</strong> in the left drop-down list, an <strong>operator </strong>at the central drop-down and a <strong>value in the text box</strong> on the right and click on select to see the result. For example, if you enter 5 in the toolbar in the picture, it will lead to a selection of the 5 polygons on the map with the smallest area.<br />
The confusing part of the interface is the <strong>‘not’</strong> between the left drop-down and the central one. For a new user, the interface reads ‘find objects on the map where the field Area (I) are not the bottom X’. The ‘not’ in this case is a toggle button that can be activated to negate the operation that was selected in the central drop-down. Clearly, it would be better if, when not activated, it had the word ‘is’ (Area is the bottom 5) and ‘not’ appeared only when it was active. This is one of the cases where usability enhancement could be carried out in less than a minute of a programmer’s time – and surely makes life less confusing to many novice users…</p></blockquote>
<p>As you might have guessed, these are only some of the usability issues one can find in Manifold, and I would appreciate any comments here if you can think of others. I have already send in suggestions to Manifold for most of these issues, and I would urge you to do the same if you can agree with my analysis.</p>
