			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you didn&#8217;t get a chance to fly down to Sydney to attend the FOSSG4 conference (I certainly didn&#8217;t!), they now have video casts up of most presentations at <a href="http://blip.tv/search?q=fosslc">http://blip.tv/search?q=fosslc</a>. One I found interesting was a great video cast of the presentation by Paul Ramsey on development progress on PostGIS at the recent FOSSG4.</p>
<p>A great mention as well for Manifold as one of the GIS packages supporting PostGIS in the video by Paul Ramsey, although he alleges to some FUD that Manifold the company spread regarding PostGIS ( at 13:15 in the video, although I don&#8217;t remember what particular Dimitri postings he was referring too :-)</p>

<p>According to Paul&#8217;s presentation, PostGreSQL (with PostGIS) certainly seems to be at least equal to other spatially enabled databases in terms of feature completeness, performance and robustness, and its free, making procurement much easier (19:00 min in video). And the new release of PostGIS seems to be all about speed improvements, which is obviously a good thing. A overview of the roadmap ahead for PostGIS promises a lot of things to come&#8230;</p>
<p>Now, my interest in PostGIS has only started lately, mostly because I was asked to develop a &#8220;Introduction to Spatial Databases&#8221; e-learning course. Given the need for students to be able to run the practicals on their home computers, we chose PostGIS and Quantum GIS as the software tools for the tutorials. I must say I have been impressed by the functionality of PostGIS, and it certainly hasn&#8217;t been a very steep learning curve for me, thanks mostly to my previous Spatial SQL knowledge learned from Manifold&#8217;s Spatial SQL experience. Although the syntax and some of the commands are slightly different between PostGIS SQL and Manifold Spatial SQL, knowledge of either is really helpful when trying to write queries! Wider issues of optimisation such as spatial indexes though present another level of complexity/power in PostGIS,Â  which Manifold&#8217;s internal SQL engine doesn&#8217;t expose to the user.</p>
