			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of the induction week for the new cohort of the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/gis/">MSc in GIS</a> here at the <a href="http://www.cege.ucl.ac.uk/">Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering</a>, I organised a <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_parties">OpenStreetMap Mapping Party</a>. OSM mapping is not only a fun activity that gets the students out of the classroom and getting to know each other, but also serves as a convenient introduction to a wide range of geo-challenges relevant to their MSc, both in terms of data collection quality and attributes, editing and updating of spatial data, as well as the visualisation and processing of collected data.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Central London is already mapped to a high level of detail (not astonishing given that OSM originates from UCL!), so we decided to focus on a much neglected topic, ie wheelchair accessibility mapping. <a href="http://wheelmap.org">Wheelmap.org</a>, a relatively new initiative to highlight wheelchair accessible places, made it painfully obvious that almost no accessibility mapping had been done so far in and around UCL!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_20110928_151337.jpg by petz, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/petzlux/6195205367/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6164/6195205367_cb1208ec50.jpg" alt="IMG_20110928_151337.jpg" width="400" height="239" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www2.cege.ucl.ac.uk/arg/people/staffpage.asp?StaffID=571">Catherine Holloway</a>, a wheelchair accessibility specialist from our department, gave a great overview of relevant attributes to map, and even brought along a couple of wheelchairs for the students to sit in! Two of the student groups experienced the difficulties when trying to move about in a wheelchair, hitting obstacles, bad dropped kerbs and rough surfaces, a valuable insight into the very specific mobility problems of London&#8217;s wheelchair users.<br />
The mapping party was also kindly supported by members of the OSM community, ie. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/GGLIOZZO">Gianfranco</a>,  <a href="http://derickrethans.nl/">Derick Rethans</a>, and Alex who shadowed groups and supported them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="IMG_20110928_150403.jpg by petz, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/petzlux/6195720974/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6141/6195720974_5bde1540dd.jpg" alt="IMG_20110928_150403.jpg" width="400" height="239" /></a></p>
<p>The first day was taken up with data collection, and the weather god(s) were very kind to us, with atypically warm and sunny weather for this time of the year, ideal to explore the different areas around UCL&#8217;s main campus. We subdivided the area into map slices, and 4 groups went off to collect data, each group recording their progress on <a href="http://walking-papers.org/">walkingpapers</a> print outs. After some initial confusion over what to capture, the groups soon got to grips with the task and went their separate ways to record: if shops and building entrances have step free access and if the toilets are wheelchair accessible; where dropped kerbs are; as well as pavement quality and minimum widths.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="IMG_20110928_155729.jpg by petz, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/petzlux/6195726730/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6170/6195726730_27e04245fe.jpg" alt="IMG_20110928_155729.jpg" width="400" height="239" /></a></p>
<p>My group did south of UCL around Tottenham Court Road, and sadly we found <a href="http://wheelmap.org/?zoom=18&amp;lat=51.51975&amp;lon=-0.13256&amp;layers=BT">a whole row of shops not wheelchair accessible in Store Street</a> (see photo above). I must say that I was shocked by the number of businesses, pubs and buildings which today are still not wheelchair accessible, just in the very small area we mapped around UCL. After a productive two hours of mapping, we reconvened at the Department, to go for a well deserved pint of beer in the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/108042">Jeremy Bentham pub</a> (an essential part of any proper mapping party!).</p>
<p><a title="IMG_20110929_142155.jpg by petz, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/petzlux/6195729596/"><img class="aligncenter" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6176/6195729596_75765a8dc1.jpg" alt="IMG_20110929_142155.jpg" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>On day 2, the students sat down to add their collected data to OSM, using Potlatch2. <a href="http://www.gravitystorm.co.uk/shine/">Andy Allan</a>, one of the lead developers of Potlatch2, joined us for the lab session to support the students, but also importantly to experience how first time editors of OSM are using his software. In parallel, I setup screen recording software to gather new data on first time users interactions with OSM&#8217;s editing tools, in this case Potlatch2, in continuation of earlier work done in <a title="OpenStreetMap – Where’s the Search?" href="http://www.spatialknowledge.eu/2011/05/openstreetmap-wheres-the-search/">usability analysis, reported here before.</a> Apart from some of the previously discussed problems in the usability of Potlatch2, of which Andy took keen notice and I am sure he will report back on as well, the students got on well with the editing. Soon the first <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/changesets?bbox=-0.136496%2C51.521571%2C-0.130826%2C51.524435">changesets </a>appeared on OSM, and the first tagged shops were updated as well on <a href="http://wheelmap.org/?zoom=17&amp;lat=51.52177&amp;lon=-0.13591&amp;layers=BT">wheelmap.org</a>. Some students even managed to finish early, taking the opportunity to edit and add information around their homes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="IMG_20110929_151204.jpg by petz, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/petzlux/6195214055/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6022/6195214055_d317111c57.jpg" alt="IMG_20110929_151204.jpg" width="400" height="239" /></a></p>
<p>The results of the mapping party can be seen in the changesets generated by the students, as well as the numerous classified shops and amenities along Tottenham Court Road and its sidestreets, visible in wheelmap.org, where before there was just a sea of grey unclassified Points of Interest.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick pointer to the <a href="http://matterhorn.zserv.tuwien.ac.at/engage/ui/watch.html?id=Unscheduled-lecturetube-treitler-1310738966681">recording of the presentation of the joint work between Dr Catherine Jones and myself here at SOTMEU</a> (I only got the video to work in Firefox!) So, far a great and vibrant conference, and our research into usability issues in OpenStreetMap was well received. I was particularly pleased by the positive reaction from a lot of conference attendants to our work, it seems that most core community members are well aware of the issues we raised, and recognise the need for improvement.</p>
<p>This small research project from us then represents the first of an ongoing effort to better embed and implement a usability engineering culture in this great project!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roughly <a href="http://neis-one.org/2010/08/%E2%80%9Enominal-members%E2%80%9C-of-osm/">70% of visitors who open an account do not go on to make a single edit to OpenStreetMap</a>. Why do the majority of people interested in editing OSM fail to add data? Is the user experience not good enough? What are some specific issues that stop contributions? These are some of the questions that I, together with <a href="http://www.port.ac.uk/departments/academic/geography/staff/title,109932,en.html">Dr Kate Jones</a>, are currently investigating through an in-depth OpenStreetMap usability study, which will be presented at the upcoming <a href="http://sotm-eu.org/">SOTM-EU conference</a>.</p>
<p>We just finished our data collection exercise, which included<a href="http://www.tobii.com/en/analysis-and-research/global/research/usability/"> eye tracking</a> and screen recording ten OSM novices through their first experience registering, adding and editing information to OSM. A OSM test server enabled participants to complete registration, search for a specific scenario area, add and edit 11 features using Potlatch2, while being tracked and observed by a researcher. Although we will present comprehensive results from this study at the conference and the proceedings, I want to give just a quick glimpse into some of the very basic issues we have uncovered so far.</p>
<h3>Where is the OSM Search?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o3ZiosKtnA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o3ZiosKtnA</a></p>
<p>We discovered that users have difficulty locating the Search on <a href="http://www.osm.org">openstreetmap.org</a>. This has been <a href="http://compton.nu/2010/02/redesigning-the-openstreetmap-web-site/">highlighted </a>before. This video shows the gaze plot of one participant looking for the OSM search. The participant first tries to find the search functionality at the top of the page, scanning from left to right and back in vain. Only after having spent 6 seconds looking at the top, the participant starts to scan and read down the left-hand side of the page, before stumbling over the search at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Questions arise over the natural way in which users scan a webpage,and preconceptions about where they would expect a search functionality to appear. According to <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/reading_pattern.html">Nielsen</a>, user reading behaviour of websites exhibits a dominant reading pattern which looks somewhat like an F, with two horizontal movements across the top and middle of a given page, before moving on to a vertical movement scanning the left content section. This pattern has been recognized and adopted by many prominent websites, creating in turn preconceptions in users as to where to expect prominent content/functionalities. Google for example consistently locates their search box on the top-left to middle of a given website.</p>
<p>This video is only an example of the consistent behaviour we have observed of participants exposing the F pattern when looking for Search. As the OSM website now stands, the Search functionality (which works  well and is helpful once found!) is not in a clear and quickly visible area of the website, but &#8220;<em>hidden</em>&#8221; in a &#8220;<em>drill-down</em>&#8221; area last seen by the user.</p>
<p>As I said, lots more stuff to come out of this study, watch this space if you can&#8217;t make it to SOTM-EU!</p>
