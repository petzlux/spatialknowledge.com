		<description>With the direction Esri is taking in the marketplace, Manifold is quickly becoming a dinosaur. Think I where they have come with Esri Maps for Office, ArcGIS Online, etc while Manifold hasn&#039;t released anything in years.  My how the tides have turned.</description>

		<description>Hi,

I am just testing Manifold to use in my consultancy business. This blog is informative but worrying. 

Q-GIS is good but not quite there yet and Manifold seemed to fit the bill. But it does have allot of irritations, seemingly deliberatly non-standard methods that steepen the learning curve for GIS professionals supposedly to ease the curve for new adopters.. and the help manual is pretty poor. So should I invest the time in Manifold or the money directly in e.g. IDRISI?

The really attractive aspect of Manifold is its cheap run time licence. But that seems to be subject to a legal challenge?</description>

		<description>I was using Manifold Universal, which is around $600. I&#039;ve had no formal GIS training, but we inherited using Manifold from a consultant. When I last wrote, I&#039;d been using Manifold for about six months. I&#039;m an engineer, and I basically use GIS as 2D(ish) CAD system for building up constraint layers for power plant location design.

When I load a layer from a data source, I want it to appear on the map I&#039;m working on immediately, thank you. Manifold made that difficult, adding steps like assigning projection, then adding the drawing to the map. Manifold&#039;s tab structure along the bottom of the map is much more cumbersome than having layers on a palette at the side. 

I stand by my shock-troops comment about the Manifold forums. I may not have followed the exact checklist required by St.Eric&#039;s &quot;How To Ask Questions The Smart Way&quot;, but one generally doesn&#039;t expect the developer of a commercial product to weigh in in a rude and aggressive manner as a response. The customer may not always be right, but he does pay your salary.

Now that QGIS is very stable on Windows, I haven&#039;t used Manifold for more than a year.</description>

How about an update on 2012?</description>

		<description>I started using Manifold when it was version 4.5 as a cheap alternative to ArcView. It&#039;s been cheering to see its rise in popularity and now saddening to see its decline over recent years. The rise in capability and robustness of FOSS products like QGIS has clearly undermined its market for users and combined with the legal problems it faces, its future as a desktop product looks very uncertain. It&#039;ll be interesting to see what 2012 brings.</description>
