		<description>Yea, I moved it. But there should be a more systematic look at redesigning the front page. More to come soon.</description>

		<description>&lt;b&gt;The search box has been moved&lt;/b&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the OpenStreetMap front page&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps in response to this analysis. Guess another difficulty with looking into use-ability is that it can be a moving target.</description>

		<description>Having so many zero-edit users makes me wonder whether some of them intended to do any edit at all. Maybe they thought creating a user was necessary to do X, but X is either possible without logging in (but was hard to find or not exactly what they expected), or simply not possible.

Another possibility is that they wanted to do non-edit stuff, like asking on help.osm.org or using the diary.

Sorry for the wild speculation (and for not knowing how to turn that speculation into knowledge). But I think it&#039;s wrong to assume zero-edit users were all thwarted by the complexity of editing the map.</description>

		<description>this article successfully ignores people with Netbooks and Notbooks, equipped with 1280x800-screen: 
There you need to scroll down (manually) to see the search field!</description>

		<description>It would be great to have some details about how to do a usability evaluation at home. Have you published your procedure and questions?</description>

		<description>Mikel - This is the usual way that usability evaluation *should* be included in the design and development process for an app, but this doesnt often happen, especially for open source software development. I hope that our work first gives some practical tips and hints at basic things that need changing, but also perhaps instil in the developers a desire to continue with usability evaluation.

Usability evaluation doesn&#039;t need to expensive and time consuming. A developer wishing to evaluate the usability of his app just needs a (his) computer, perhaps with screen recording software for later review, and a willing &quot;non-expert&quot; which hasn&#039;t used his software/website/service before. The eye tracking is a nice to have rather than a necessity. The key point is for the first time user to &quot;Think Aloud&quot;, ie express verbally what they are trying to do, where they expect things to be, how they feel interacting with the software, and a patient passive! observer. The observer has to be passive, ie not be quick to jump in and help/guide the user, or else you wont be able to see where things dont work.</description>

		<description>Since the issue came up - do you think locating the search box slowly is a problem? Try not having the search box on the screen at all - because you happen to have a not-quite-state-of-the-art laptop, with an 1280x800 native resolution, on which the search box simply falls off below the bottom screen edge. The SOTM ad was the last straw - I simply threw out everything but the search box using the RIP extension from the page, end of story.

Also, out of curiosity - how long does it take for a novice to realize that on the OSM wiki, the search box he just located on the bottom-left earlier jumped right back top-right...? I&#039;m a member for over three years now, and I still lose a few seconds realizing this every single time I look for it...

...anyway, sorry to &quot;take this out&quot; on you, good job pointing all of this out!</description>
