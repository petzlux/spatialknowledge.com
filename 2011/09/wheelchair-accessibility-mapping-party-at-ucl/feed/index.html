		<description>Loughborough University in the UK is researching how different kinds of information may help wheelchair users feel more confident when planning trips. This is an open invitation to all wheelchair users and their careers to take part in this research and help make access better for all www.freetraveller.co.uk. Also you could win £150 ($250)!

We also use OpenStreetMap as our map database for the project, so any wheelchair users who like OSM will enjoy participating that little bit more.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m really glad you did this rather than getting scared-off by some talks/conversations at SotM-EU. It seems like you did it very well and they had a good time, with local mappers involved too.

I like how you picked a specific detail/user-interest to map, wheelchair accessibility, due to the area being well mapped already. I was wondering how I would teach someone if I&#039;ve mapped everything already.

On the usability testing, had the previous group done any surveying themselves? I imagine this makes some difference, at least physiological.</description>
